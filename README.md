# qmqtt2qml
A converter class between the [qmqtt](https://github.com/emqtt/qmqtt) library and QT's qml framework.

This project demonstrates how to interface between the qmqtt library van QML. It is based on an 
[quicksubscription example](https://github.com/qt/qtmqtt/tree/5.11/examples/mqtt/quicksubscription) which is part
of the QtQmqtt module.

Note that the main.qml file in this repository has been copied from the quicksubscription example and adjusted
wherever necessary.

__At this moment, the project has not been tested properly. Use it at your own risk.__
